# Python Data Science

A Workshop I completed with the FAU Data Science and Machine Learning Club as an introduction to Data Science and Data Visualization using Jupyter Notebook. 

This repo begins with a general introduction to python, the use of Jupyter Notebook and external libraries, and ends with 2 example case studies which analyze the given datasets, provide visualization, and recommendations as if they are real case studies for clients.
